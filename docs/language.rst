==============================
The Sketch Templating Language
==============================
The sketch templating language is aiming to generate flexible output for arbitrary
text file. It is designed for Pythonistas with statement marks inspired by ERB
and a Python like syntax.

Example
=======
.. code-block:: text

    <!DOCTYPE>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title><%= await handler.get_page_title() %></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <main>
                <% async for item in handler.db.items.find() %>
                    <article>
                        <div class="title"><%= item["title"] %></div>
                        <div class="author"><%= item["author"] %></div>
                        <div class="content"><%= item["content"] %></div>
                    </article>
                <% end %>
            </main>
        </body>
    </html>

Contents between :code:`<%` and :code:`%>` may look quite similar to Python
syntax. As a matter of fact, Sketchbook rewrites sketches into Python code and
asks the Python interpreter to "compile" the plain Python code into Python byte
code.

Hence, You can use (almost) all Python syntax in your sketches but with some
modifications:

1. All python style syntax is wrapped between :code:`<%` and :code:`%>`.
2. Indentation is not indicated by :code:`:` any more, but controlled by a
   special :code:`<% end %>` statement.

Also, :func:`print` function still prints to :code:`sys.stdout` by default.
To print to the template, use :meth:`.SketchRuntime.write` or output
statements.

Statement Mark
==============
All the statements are wrapped under statement marks -
:code:`<%` and :code:`%>`.

Statement Mark Escape
---------------------
:code:`<%%` and :code:`%%>` escape :code:`<%` and :code:`%>` respectively.
e.g.: The following sketch::

    <%% is the begin mark, and <%r= "%%> is the end mark. " %>
    <%r= "<% and" %> %> only need to be escaped whenever they
    are ambiguous to the templating system.

will be drawn like::

    <% is the begin mark, and %> is the end mark.
    <% and %> only need to be escaped whenever they
    have ambiguity of the templating system.

Output
======
The most commonly-used(perhaps) statement in the Templating System.

.. code-block: python3
    Hello, <%= user.name %>.

:code:`=` is the statement keyword, and the expression following the keyword
will be evaluated by the interpreter. You can also :code:`await` a
:class:`collections.abc.Awaitable`::

    Hello, <%= await user.get_user_name() %>.

The result will be passed to :meth:`.SketchRuntime.write()` and escaped by the
:code:`default` escape function.

.. _raw-output:

Raw Output
----------
To output raw strings without escaping, use :code:`raw=` (or :code:`r=` for
shorthand) as a keyword. In this case, :code:`raw` is the escape function for
statement instead of :code:`default`.

For how to override the default escape function, define
custom escape functions and view built-in escape functions, please see the
documentation for :class:`.BaseSketchContext`.

Indentation
===========
Indentation is used to control the flow on how the sketch is drawn. There're
three types of keywords to control the indentation:

- Indent keywords: :code:`if`, :code:`with`, :code:`for`, :code:`while`, :code:`try` and :code:`async`.
- Unident keyword: :code:`end`.
- Half-indent keywords: :code:`else`, :code:`elif`, :code:`except` and :code:`finally`.

Indent keywords is used to start an indentation, and the unindent keyword is used to
finish the indentation created by the last indent keyword.

Half Indentation
----------------
Half-indent keywords is a special type. It unindents the last indentation, and
establishes a new indentation at the same time.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    <% if a == b %>
        <%= "They are the same." %>
    <% else %>
        <%= "They are not the same." %>
    <% end %>

The :code:`if` statement creates an indenation as discussed above, and the
:code:`else` statement will automatically unident the :code:`if` statement, and
create a new indentation until another unindent statement or
half-indent statement is reached.

.. warning::

  Redundant or missing unindent statements will raise a :class:`.SketchSyntaxError`.

Inline
======
The statement represents a Python inline keyword.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    <% from time import time as get_timestamp %>
    <% import random %>

    <% while True %>
        <%r= str(get_timestamp()) %>
        <% if random.choice(range(0, 2)) %>
            <% break %>
        <% end %>
    <% end %>

This example will output timestamps until a positive value is selected by
:func:`random.random()`.

.. note::

    Keywords of inline statements are :code:`break`, :code:`continue`,
    :code:`import`, :code:`from`, :code:`raise`, :code:`assert`,
    :code:`nonlocal`, and :code:`global`.

Variable Assignment
===================
In Python language, keyword :code:`=` is used to assign values to variables.
However, in order to set a variable in sketches, you have to use an additional
keyword :code:`let`:

.. code-block:: text

    <% try %>
        <%= a %>
    <% except NameError %>
        Variable a is not set.
    <% end %>

    <% let a = "whatever" %>
    Variable a is set to <%= a %>.

This should output

.. code-block:: text

    Variable a is not set.
    Variable a is set to whatever.

Inclusion
=========
Include another sketch into the current sketch.

Example:

:code:`header.html`:

.. code-block:: text

    <header>
        <h1>Site Title</h1>
    </header>

:code:`main.html`:

.. code-block:: text

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Main Page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <% include "header.html" %>
            <main>
                <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
            </main>
        </body>
    </html>

When :code:`main.html` is being drawn, it will ask the finder to find
:code:`header.html` and draw :code:`header.html` at the runtime,
then append it to the result of :code:`main.html`.

The result of the example above is:

.. code-block:: text

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Main Page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <header>
                <h1>Site Title</h1>
            </header>
            <main>
                <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
            </main>
        </body>
    </html>

Inheritance
===========
Inherit from other sketches. When a sketch with an :code:`inherit` statement is
being drawn, a subclass of :class:`.BaseSketchFinder` will find the parent sketch.
The parent sketch will then being drawn with :code:`.SketchRuntime.body` set to the output
of the original sketch. The blocks of the parent sketch will be replaced with the
ones in the child sketch.

Example:

:code:`layout.html`:

.. code-block:: text

    <html>
        <head>
            <title><% block title %><% end %></title>
            <% block head %><% end %>
        </head>
        <body>
            <%r= self.body %>
        </body>
    </html>

:code:`main.html`:

.. code-block:: text

    <% inherit "layout.html" %>
    <% block title %>Main Page<% end %>
    <main>
        <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
    </main>

When :code:`main.html` is being drawn, it will ask the sketch finder to find
:code:`layout.html` and update all the blocks in :code:`layout.html` with blocks in
:code:`main.html`. Other content outside blocks in :code:`main.html` can be
accessed using :code:`self.body` in :code:`layout.html`.

.. hint::

    If Inheritance is not enabled, the :code:`block` statement has no effect.

.. important::

    When drawing the :code:`self.body`, make sure to use :ref:`raw-output`,
    or the it may be escaped.

.. warning::

    If the sketch being drawn is not a parent of another sketch, using :code:`self.body`
    will raise an :class:`.SketchDrawingError`.

The result of the example above is:

.. code-block:: text

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Main Page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <main>
        <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
    </main>
        </body>
    </html>

Comment
=======
Strings that will be removed from the result.

.. code-block:: text

    This is the content.
    <%# This is a comment. %>

When the sketch is being drawn, the comment will be excluded.

The result of the example above is:

.. code-block:: text

    This is the content.
